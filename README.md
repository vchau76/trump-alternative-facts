# Trump's misleading or false claims visualized
JupyterLab script using Python to scrape the Washington Post's Fact Check database for all of Trump's misleading or false claims. Script uses Selenium for interactive features on the page and BeautifulSoup for scraping the necessary data.  Data is available in the repository as a CSV file named DT_lies.csv.

Using the scraped data, I created a visualization of his claims using Tableau.
